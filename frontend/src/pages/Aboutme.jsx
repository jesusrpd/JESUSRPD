            <p>
                I consider myself a self-taught and responsible person, from the
                age of 16 I began to learn to program in js, from there I
                increased my skills learning non-relational database management,
                REST API creation. In addition to learning topics and the
                management of design software such as Photoshop, Ilustraitor,
                Affter Effects etc ... I also know how to work as a team,
                learning from others and never settle for what I already know.
